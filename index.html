<h2>𝕋ℍ𝔼 𝔻𝔸𝕀𝕃𝕐 𝕄𝔸𝕀𝕃 - New Font App takes over WhatsApp.</h2>
<p>A new font app called FancyKey Pro allows people to use different fonts on WhatsApp. These fonts may seem fine to use but, they are not. People are able to make text illegible which can be extremely bad in a dangerous situation. Using this app can give you up to 5 years jail time.</p>
